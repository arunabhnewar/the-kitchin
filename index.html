            <p class="para left down">Hi, I’m Scarlet, food lover, food blogger and head chef in The Kitchin.
                I believe that living a healthy life is possible not with diet, but with healthy food. That is why I
                am
                always aware of healthy food. I also like to experiment with food recipes, and take care not to lose
                the
                nutritional value of the food.

            <p class="para">Pizza, favored by all ages, dates back to 1889. Pizza, garnished with Mozzarella and
                tomatoes, was
                normally known as the dish for poor
                people until it became a famous dish for the wealthy when Queen
                Margherita had it as a meal as well. Pizza, with sauces and spices such as basil and garlic added
                later on, gets recognition by other nations with the arrival of Italian immigrants to the United
                States. The spread of pizza all over the world is due to the initiatives of the Americans.</p>
